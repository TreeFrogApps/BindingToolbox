    <string name="perfect_binding">PERFECT BINDING</string>
    <string name="pur_binding">PUR BINDING</string>
    <string name="binding_types_header">
        This application focuses on Perfect and PUR Binding, which are a very common form of binding and are widely used.</string>

     <string name="perfect_binding_2">
        Folded sections, or single leaves of text are gathered on top of each other to form a complete set.
        A small amount is the ground off the spine edge and EVA glue (ethylene vinyl acetate) is applied.
        The cover is then placed on and wrapped around the text. After a short period of drying the top,
        bottom and fore-edge are trimmed to finish size.</string>

    <string name="pur_binding_2">
        In essence this uses the exact same process as Perfect Binding, the only difference is the type of glue used.
        PUR Binding uses a polyurethane reactive adhesive.  PUR Binding offers advantages over Perfect Binding,
        although both types are widely used.  Typically PUR Binding uses less glue on the spine of a book,
        offering a more ’squared look’ to the spine, also it is around 40-60%% stronger (page pull tests)
        with more flexibility and pliability.
    </string>

    <string name="paper_heading">The main difference between paper is whether it is ‘coated’ or ‘uncoated’.
        Both types are measured in grams per square metre (gsm).  Uncoated stock is thicker is comparison
        to a coated stock of the same weight.</string>

    <string name="paper_coated">COATED PAPER</string>

    <string name="paper_coated_2">This paper type is generally smooth, it can have a gloss, matt or silk finish.
        It can have a coating on one or both sides, but generally it will be on both sides.  When used in
        litho printing it produces sharp and clear image as the coating restricts the amount of water and ink
        that is absorbed.  Coated paper is widely used for magazines, brochures and book covers.</string>

    <string name="paper_uncoated">UNCOATED PAPER</string>

    <string name="paper_uncoated_2">As the name suggests uncoated paper does not have a coating.  It is generally
        more absorbent and will have a coarser feel to it. Preprint is a type of uncoated paper and is generally used for
        letterheads and compliment slips as it allows for ‘overprinting’ with a inkjet or laser printer.</string>

    <string name="help_1">This application is primarily aimed at anyone in the Graphic Design, Print and PrePress industry,
        but is useful to anyone who needs to find out the spine width and weight of a Perfect and PUR bound book. Although you don\'t have to put
        in the book size this is often helpful especially if these produced books are for mailing and weight tariffs and costings apply</string>

    <string name="help_2">Follow the steps in the Binding Calculator as follows:</string>
    <string name="help_3">1. Choose a name (optional, but will be used in the history tab)</string>
    <string name="help_4">2. Enter the books dimensions in millimeters</string>
    <string name="help_5">3. Enter the number of TEXT pages (not including cover)</string>
    <string name="help_6">4. Enter the stock (paper) weight (this is measured in ISO 536 standard grams per square metre, or gsm for short)</string>
    <string name="help_7">5. Press the calculate button</string>
    <string name="help_8"> Disclaimer: \n\nAlthough thorough testing has been performed, and used in a commercial environment all final results are not the conclusively 100%% accurate as paper manufacturers work within tolerances of 5%%.
              No responsibility or liability is taken for any inaccurate calculations.</string>
